<h1>6.830: Lecture 9 (10/08/09)</h1>

In this lecture, we will discuss the problem of query optimization, focusing
on the algorithms proposed in the classic "Selinger" paper.
<p>

Read the following papers:

D. Chamberlin, Raymond Lorie, and T. Price.</a>  <u>Access Path Selection

This paper discusses
many of the techniques that used to make query optimization and cost
estimation practical in modern database systems.  Will will cover some
of the ideas at a high level in class.
</ul>


As you read, think about and come to class prepared to answer the
following questions:

<p>
<ul>

<li> The Selinger paper claims to be 'optimal'.  Under what
assumptions is this optimality true? Can you think of a situation in
which Selinger will definitely be non-optimal?

<li> Query optimization is highly dependent on the effectiveness of
cost estimation.  The cost metrics that Selinger proposes are very
simple; how would you make them more sophisticated?  What is the
impact of more sophisticated cost metrics on the performance of a
database system?

</ul>
