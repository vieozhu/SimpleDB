<h1>6.830: Lecture 2 (9/15/09)</h1>

In this lecture, we will continue our discussion of data models and
database system architecture, looking in more detail at the relational
model. 

<!-- and focusing in particular on the implications of that model for
database system design. -->

<p>

There is a lot of reading for this lecture.  You should start early and try to
digest it all, as it lays the foundation for much of what is to come.  The
papers are:

<ul>
<p>

<li>Michael Stonebraker and Joseph Hellerstein. <u>What Goes Around Comes
Around</u>.  In "Readings in Database Systems" (aka the Red Book), or
online <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/chapters/0262693143chapm1.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/chapters/0262693143chapm1.pdf'" tppabs="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/chapters/0262693143chapm1.pdf">here (link to PDF)</a>.   Read
Sections 1-4 (if you know something about XML, you may also enjoy reading
Sections 10 and 11;  they are classic Stonebraker).

<li>E.F. Codd. <u>A relational model of data for large shared data banks</u>.
Communications of the ACM, 1970. [<a
href="javascript:if(confirm('http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=362685&type=pdf&coll=GUIDE&dl=GUIDE&CFID=1781172&CFTOKEN=98614393  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=362685&type=pdf&coll=GUIDE&dl=GUIDE&CFID=1781172&CFTOKEN=98614393'" tppabs="http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=362685&type=pdf&coll=GUIDE&dl=GUIDE&CFID=1781172&CFTOKEN=98614393">PDF</a>].
(This is linked to the ACM website and is only accessible with an ACM account
or from an MIT IP. Focus on Sections 1.3 and all of Section
2.)

<p>


<!-- <li> <a name="anatomy">Joseph Hellerstein and Michael Stonebraker.
<u>The Anatomy of a Database System</u>.  Red Book.  Read Sections 1-4 and
6-7. -->

</ul>

<p>

You may also find in useful to read pages 57-63 of Ramakrishnan and
Gehrke for a brief overview of the relational model.

<p>
As you read these papers, think about and be prepared to answer the
following questions in Lecture:


<ol>
<li> What is the notion of data independence?  Why is it important?

<li> Codd spends a fair
amount of time talking about "Normal forms".  Why is it important that
a database be stored in a normal form?  

<li> What are the key ideas behind the relational model?  Why are they
an improvement over what came before?  In what ways is the relational model restrictive?

<li> What, according to Codd, are the most important differences
between the "hierarchical" model (as exemplified by systems like IMS)
and the relational model that Codd proposes? Make sure you understand
what Codd means by "Data Dependencies".
