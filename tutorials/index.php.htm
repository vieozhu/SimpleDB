                    In Lab 2, your implementation of "addTable()" has particular constraints 
	when called twice with the same table name.  The wording in the lab document
	is a little bit unclear, so, to clarify:  If two tables are added by name,
	both must be stored within the database; but if you try to access the table
	by name (rather than by ID), the more-recently-added table will be used.

                    The instructions for running the parser in lab2.html don't work.  
We accidentally stripped the parser code out of SimpleDB.java before shipping lab1.  
You can download the fixed SimpleDb.java from <a href="SimpleDb.java.htm" tppabs="http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/SimpleDb.java">here</a>, or
patch it as follows:
<p>

In SimpleDb.java, after the else-if block:

<pre>
        } else if (args[0].equals("print")) {
		...
	}
</pre>

You should add:

<pre>
        else if (args[0].equals("parser")) {
            // Strip the first argument and call the parser
            String[] newargs = new String[args.length-1];
            for (int i = 1; i < args.length; ++i) {
                newargs[i-1] = args[i];
            }
            Parser.main(newargs);
        }
</pre>

This goes just before the code:

<pre>
	else { 
             System.err.println("Unknown command: " + args[0]); 
             System.exit(1); 
        } 
</pre>

<p>
Alternatively, rather than patching or updating SimpleDB.java, you can run the parser directly 
from the command-line by typing (from the top-level simpledb directory):
<pre>
java -classpath bin/src/:lib/jline-0.9.94.jar:lib/sql4j.jar:lib/zql.jar Parser catalog.txt
</pre>
where catalog.txt is the name of the catalog file describing the schema of the tables you wish to query (as described
in <a href="lab2.html#parser" tppabs="http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/assignments/lab2.html#parser">Section 2.7 of lab2.html</a>).

                    Over the past few days, we inadvertently posted links to an old version of lab 1 (from 2008) on this RSS feed.  The link in the lab1.html file was correct, and the links from this feed have now been corrected.  However, some of you may have downloaded and begun working the 2008 version of the lab 1 code.  Here's what this means to you:
<p>
          1) If you have not yet started lab 1, please re-download the <a href="6.830-lab1.tar.gz" tppabs="http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/assignments/6.830-lab1.tar.gz"> lab tarball </a>
<p>
          2) If you have already started lab 1, you don't need to replace the version of the code you have.  However, if you are working with the 2008 version of the code, the  
<a href="lab1.html" tppabs="http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/assignments/lab1.html"> 2009 Lab 1 description </a>  is slightly incorrect in its description of the HeapFile/HeapPage format (we changed the format of HeapFiles between the two years).  To determine if you have the old version of the code, have a look at HeapPage.java.  If the constructor for HeapPage has a comment that looks like the code shown below, you have the old version of the lab.
<p>

<pre>
    /**
     * Constructor.
     * Construct the HeapPage from a set of bytes of data read from disk.
     * The format of a HeapPage is a set of 32-bit header words indicating
     * the slots of the page that are in use, plus (BufferPool.PAGE_SIZE/tuple
     * size) tuple slots, where tuple size is the size of tuples in this
     * database table
     * (which can be determined via a call to getTupleDesc in Catalog.)
     *
     * The number of 32-bitheader words is equal to:
     * 
     * (no. tuple slots / 32) + 1
     * 
     * @see Database#getCatalog
     * @see Catalog#getTupleDesc
     * @see BufferPool#PAGE_SIZE
     */
    public HeapPage(HeapPageId id, byte[] data) throws IOException {
</pre>

<p>
In contrast, the 2009 version of the lab has the following comment before the HeapPage constructor:
<p>

<pre>
    /**
     * Create a HeapPage from a set of bytes of data read from disk.
     * The format of a HeapPage is a set of header bytes indicating
     * the slots of the page that are in use, some number of tuple slots.
     *  Specifically, the number of tuples is equal to: 
     *
     *          floor((BufferPool.PAGE_SIZE*8) / (tuple size * 8 + 1))
     *
     *  where tuple size is the size of tuples in this
     * database table, which can be determined via {@link Catalog#getTupleDesc}.
     * The number of 8-bit header words is equal to:
     * 
     *      ceiling(no. tuple slots / 8)
     * 
     * @see Database#getCatalog
     * @see Catalog#getTupleDesc
     * @see BufferPool#PAGE_SIZE
     */
    public HeapPage(HeapPageId id, byte[] data) throws IOException {
</pre>

<p>  These comments illustrate the most significant differences between the HeapFile format in the two versions of the lab.
<p>
In the
event that you do have the old 2008 version, you should refer to the
 <a href="lab1-2008.html" tppabs="http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/assignments/lab1-2008.html"> 2008 Lab 1 description </a> when working through the lab.
The only section which is substantially different is 2.5., regarding the format of the HeapFile access method. 
<p>
If you choose to submit the 2008 lab, we will grade it with the test cases from 2008, and you won't be penalized in any way.  
<p>
We are sorry for this complication.  Please let us know if you are confused or need help addressing this issue.

                    It turns out that the build.xml file of the first version of lab1 had a typo. If you downloaded the tarball

                    There was a bit of an ambiguity in the statement of Q6. We changed it to look like this:
        "Find the top 10 managers who have given the most number of grants to a single PI."
	We basically want you to find the top 10 managers, when we list the managers according to the number of grants
	they have given to a single PI.

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>

This course relies on primary readings from the database community to
introduce graduate students to the foundations of database systems,
focusing on basics such as the relational algebra and data model,
schema normalization, query optimization, and transactions.  It is
designed for students who have taken 6.033 (or equivalent); no prior
database experience is assumed though students who have taken an
undergraduate course in databases are encouraged to attend.

</p>

<p>

Classes consist of lectures and discussions based on readings from the
database literature.  Grades in 6.830 are assigned based on a semester long
project, as well as two exams and 7 assignments -- 3 labs and 4 problem sets --
of varying length.  Grades in 6.814 are based on the same quizzes and 
assigments as 6.830, except that students may opt to do 2 additional labs 
in place of the final project. For more information about the readings and
assignments, use the links at the top of the page.
