<h1>6.830 Lab 3: SimpleDB Transactions</h1>

<b>Assigned: Friday, October 16</b><br>
<b>Due: Thursday, October 29</b>

<p>

In this lab, you will implement a simple locking-based
transaction system in SimpleDB.  You will need to add lock and
unlock calls at the appropriate places in your code, as well as
code to track the locks held by each transaction and grant
locks to transactions as they are needed.

<p>



<p>

The remainder of this document describes what is involved in
adding transaction support and provides a basic outline of how
you might add this support to your database.

<p>

As with the previous lab, we recommend that you start as early as possible.
Locking and transactions can be quite tricky to debug!

<h2> 0.  Find bugs, be patient, earn candybars </h2>

<p>

It is very possible you are going to find bugs, inconsistencies, and
bad, outdated, or incorrect documentation, etc.  We apologize
profusely.  We did our best, but, alas, we are fallible human beings.

</p>

<p>

We ask you, therefore, to do this lab with an adventurous mindset.
Don't get mad if something is not clear, or even wrong; rather, try to figure
it out yourself or send us a friendly email.  We promise to help out by
sending bugfixes, new tarballs, etc.

</p>

<p>

...and if you find a bug in our code, we'll give you a candybar (see <a
href="#bugs">Section 3.3</a>)!


<h2> 1. Getting started </h2>

You should begin with the code you submitted for Lab 2 (if you did not
submit code for Lab 2, or your solution didn't work properly, contact us to
discuss options.)  We have provided you with extra test cases for this lab
that are not in the original code distribution you received. We reiterate
that the unit tests we provide are to help guide your implementation along,
but they are not intended to be comprehensive or to establish correctness.

<p>

You will need to add these new test cases to your release. The easiest way
to do this is to untar the new code in the same directory as your top-level
simpledb directory, as follows:

<ul>

<li>Make a backup of your Lab 2 solution by typing :
<pre>$ tar -cvzf 6.830-lab2-submitted.tar.gz 6.830-lab2</pre>

<li>Change to the directory that contains your top-level simpledb
code:
<pre>
$ cd 6.830-lab2
</pre>

<li>

Download the new tests and skeleton code for Lab 3 from <a
href="6.830-lab3-supplement.tar.gz" tppabs="http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/6.830-lab3-supplement.tar.gz">
http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/6.830-lab3-supplement.tar.gz</a>:
<pre>
$ wget http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/6.830-lab3-supplement.tar.gz
</pre>

<li>Extract the new files for Lab 3 by typing:

<pre>tar -xvzf 6.830-lab3-supplement.tar.gz</pre>

  This will not overwrite any existing files, but will just add new tests to
  the <code>test/simpledb</code> and <code>test/simpledb/systemtest</code> directories,
  as well as adding the new file <code>src/simpledb/Transaction.java</code>.

  
</ul>


<p>


<h2> 2. Transactions, Locking, and Concurrency Control </h2>

You do not need to write a great deal of code for this lab,
but the code you do have to write is quite tricky.  Before starting,
you should make sure you understand what a transaction is and how
strict two-phase locking (which you will use to ensure isolation and
atomicity of your transactions) works.
<p>
In the remainder of this section, we briefly overview these concepts 
and discuss how they relate to SimpleDB.

<h3> 2.1. Transactions </h3>

A transaction is a group of database actions (e.g., inserts, deletes,
and reads) that are executed <i>atomically</i>; that is, either all of
the actions complete or none of them do, and it is not apparent to an
outside observer of the database that these actions were not completed
as a part of a single, indivisible action.

<h3> 2.2. The ACID Properties </h3>

To help you understand
 how transaction management works in SimpleDB, we briefly review how
it  ensures that the ACID properties are satisfied:
<ul>
<li><b>Atomicity</b>:  Strict two-phase locking and careful buffer management
  ensure atomicity.</li>
<li><b>Consistency</b>:  The database is transaction consistent by virtue of
  atomicity.  Other consistency issues (e.g., key constraints) are
  not addressed in SimpleDB.</li>
<li><b>Isolation</b>: Strict two-phase locking provides isolation.</li>
<li><b>Durability</b>: A FORCE buffer management policy ensures
  durability (see Section 2.3 below).</li>
</ul>

<h3> 2.3. Recovery and Buffer Management </h3>

To simplify your job, we recommend that you implement a NO STEAL/FORCE
buffer management policy.  

As we discussed in class, this means that:
<ul>
<li> You shouldn't evict dirty (updated) pages from the buffer pool if they
  are locked by an uncommitted transaction (this is NO STEAL).
<li> On transaction commit, you should force dirty pages to disk (e.g.,
  write the pages out) (this is FORCE).
</ul>

To further simplify your life, you may assume that SimpleDB will not crash
while processing a <code>transactionComplete</code> command.  Note that
these three points mean that you do not need to implement log-based
recovery in this lab, since you will never need to undo any work (since you never evict
dirty pages) and you will never need to redo any work (since you force
updates on commit and will not crash during commit processing). 

<h3> 2.4. Granting Locks </h3>

You will need to add calls to SimpleDB (in <code>BufferPool</code>,
for example), that allow a caller to request or release a (shared or
exclusive) lock on a specific object on behalf of a specific
transaction.

<p>

We recommend locking at <i>page</i> granularity, though you should be able
to implement locking at <i>tuple</i> granularity if you wish (please do not
implement table-level locking). The rest of this document and our unit
tests assume page-level locking.
<p>

You will need to create data structures that keep track of which locks
each transaction holds and that check to see if a lock should be granted
to a transaction when it is requested.
<p>
You will need to implement shared and exclusive locks; recall that these
work as follows:
<ul>
<li> Before a transaction can read an object, it must have a shared lock on it.
<li> Before a transaction can write an object, it must have an exclusive lock on it.
<li> Multiple transactions can have a shared lock on an object.
<li> Only one transaction may have an exclusive lock on an object.
<li> No transaction
  may have a shared lock on an object if another transaction has an exclusive lock on it.
<li> If transaction <i>t</i> is the only transaction holding a lock on
			      an object <i>o</i>, <i>t</i> may <i>upgrade</i>
			      its lock on <i>o</i> to a exclusive lock.
</ul>

<p>

If a transaction requests a lock that it should not be granted, your code
should <i>block</i>, waiting for that lock to become available (i.e., be
released by another transaction running in a different thread).

<p>

You need to be especially careful to avoid race conditions when
writing the code that acquires locks -- think about how you will
ensure that correct behavior results if two threads request the same
lock at the same time (you way wish to read about <a
href="javascript:if(confirm('http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/concurrency/sync.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/concurrency/sync.html'" tppabs="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/concurrency/sync.html">
Synchronizing Threads in Java</a>).

<div class="exercise"><b>Exercise 1.</b>

  Write the methods that acquire and release locks in BufferPool. Assuming
  you are using page-level locking, you will need to complete the following:
  <ul>
  <li> Modify <tt>getPage()</tt> to block and acquire the desired lock
       before returning a page.
  <li> Implement <tt>releasePage()</tt>.  This method is primarily used
    for testing, and at the end of transactions.
  <li> Implement <tt>holdsLock()</tt> so that logic in Exercise 2 can 
       determine whether a page is already locked by a transaction.
  </ul>

  <p>
  You may find it helpful to define a class that is responsible for
  maintaining state about transactions and locks, but the design is up to
  you.

  <p>
  You may need to implement the next exercise before your code passes 
  the unit tests in LockingTest.
</div>


<h3> 2.5. Lock Lifetime </h3>

You will need to implement strict two-phase locking.  This means that
transactions should acquire the appropriate type of lock on any object
before accessing that object and shouldn't release any locks until after
the transaction commits.  

<p>

Fortunately, the SimpleDB design is such that is possible obtain locks on
pages in <code>BufferPool.getPage()</code> before you read or modify them.
So, rather than adding calls to locking routines in each of your operators,
we recommend acquiring locks in <code>getPage()</code>. Depending on your
implementation, it is possible that you may not have to acquire a lock
anywhere else. It is up to you to verify this!

<p>

You will need to acquire a <i>shared</i> lock on any page (or tuple)
before you read it, and you will need to acquire an <i>exclusive</i>
lock on any page (or tuple) before you write it. You will notice that
we are already passing around <code>Permissions</code> objects in the
BufferPool; these objects indicate the type of lock that the caller
would like to have on the object being accessed (we have given you the
code for the <code>Permissions</code> class.)

<p> Note that your implementation of <code>HeapFile.addTuple()</code>
and <code>HeapFile.deleteTuple()</code>, as well as the implementation
of the iterator returned by <code>HeapFile.iterator()</code> should
access pages using <code>BufferPool.getPage()</code>. Double check
that that these different uses of <code>getPage()</code> pass the
correct permissions object (e.g., <code>Permissions.READ_WRITE</code>
or <code>Permissions.READ_ONLY</code>). You may also wish to double
check that your implementation of
<code>BufferPool.insertTuple()</code> and
<code>BufferPool.deleteTupe()</code> call <code>markDirty()</code> on
any of the pages they access (you should have done this when you
implemented this code in lab 2, but we did not test for this case.)

<p>

After you have acquired locks, you will need to think about when to
release them as well. It is clear that you should release all locks
associated with a transaction after it has committed or aborted, but it is
possible for there to be other scenarios in which releasing a lock before
a transaction ends might be useful.

<p>

<div class="exercise"><b>Exercise 2.</b>

  Ensure that you acquire and release locks throughout SimpleDB. Some (but
  not necessarily all) actions that you should verify work properly:
  <ul>
  <li> Reading tuples off of pages during a SeqScan (if you
    implemented locking  in <code>BufferPool.getPage()</code>, this should work
    correctly as long as your <code>HeapFile.iterator()</code> uses
     <code>getPage()</code>.)
  <li> Inserting and deleting tuples through BufferPool and HeapFile
       methods (if you
    implemented locking in <code>BufferPool.getPage()</code>, this should work
    correctly as long as <code>HeapFile.addTuple()</code> and
<code>HeapFile.deleteTuple()</code> uses
     <code>getPage()</code>.)
  </ul>

  
  You will also want to think especially hard about acquiring and releasing
  locks in the following situations:

  <ul>
  <li> Adding a new page to a <code>HeapFile</code>.  When do you physically 
  write the page to disk?  Are there race conditions with other transactions 
  (on other threads) that might need special attention at the HeapFile level,
  regardless of page-level locking?
  <li> Looking for an empty slot into which you can insert tuples.
  Most implementations scan pages looking for an empty
  slot, and will need a READ_ONLY lock to do this.  Surprisingly, however,
    if a transaction <i>t</i> finds no free slot on a page <i>p</i>, <i>t</i> may immediately release the lock on <i>p</i>.
    Although this apparently contradicts the rules of two-phase locking, it is ok because
    <i>t</i> did not use any data from the page, such that a concurrent transaction <i>t'</i> which updated
    <i>p</i> cannot possibly effect the answer or outcome of <i>t</i>. 
 </ul>

  At this point, your code should pass the unit tests in
  LockingTest.
</div>

<h3> 2.6. Implementing NO STEAL </h3>

<p> Modifications from a transaction are written to disk only after it
commits. This means we can abort a transaction by discarding the dirty
pages and rereading them from disk. Thus, we must not evict dirty
pages. This policy is called NO STEAL.

<p> You will need the <tt>flushPage</tt> method <tt>BufferPool</tt>.
In particular, it must never evict a dirty page. If your eviction policy prefers a dirty page
for eviction, you will have to find a way to evict an alternative
page. In the case where all pages in the buffer pool are dirty, you
should throw a <tt>DbException</tt>.

<p> Note that, in general, evicting a clean page that is locked by a
running transaction is OK when using NO STEAL, as long as your lock
manager keeps information about evicted pages around, and as long as
none of your operator implementations keep references to Page objects
which have been evicted.


<div class="exercise"><b>Exercise 3.</b>
Implement the necessary logic for page eviction without evicting dirty pages
in the <tt>evictPage</tt> method in <tt>BufferPool</tt>.
</div>
<p>

<h3> 2.7. Transactions </h3>

In SimpleDB, a <code>TransactionId</code> object is created at the
beginning of each query.  This object is passed to each of the operators
involved in the query.  When the query is complete, the
<code>BufferPool</code> method <code>transactionComplete</code> is called.

<p>

Calling this method either <i>commits</i> or <i>aborts</i>  the
transaction, specified by the parameter flag <code>commit</code>. At any point
during its execution, an operator may throw a
<code>TransactionAbortedException</code> exception, which indicates an
internal error or deadlock has occurred.  The test cases we have provided
you with create the appropriate <code>TransactionId</code> objects, pass
them to your operators in the appropriate way, and invoke
<code>transactionComplete</code> when a query is finished.  We have also
implemented <code>TransactionId</code>.

<p>

<div class="exercise"><b>Exercise 4.</b>

  Implement the <code>transactionComplete()</code> method in
  <code>BufferPool</code>. Note that there are two versions of 
  transactionComplete, one which accepts an additional boolean <b>commit</b> argument,
  and one which does not.  The version without the additional argument should
  always commit and so can be implemented by calling  <code>transactionComplete(tid, true)</code>. 
  
  <p>
  
  When you commit, you should flush dirty pages
  associated to the transaction to disk. When you abort, you should revert
  any changes made by the transaction by restoring the page to its on-disk
  state.


  <p>

  Whether the transaction commits or aborts, you should also release any state the
  BufferPool keeps regarding
  the transaction, including releasing any locks that the transaction held.

  <p>
  At this point, your code should pass the TransactionTest unit test and the
  AbortEvictionTest system test.  You may find the TransactionTest system test
  illustrative, but it will likely fail until you complete the next exercise.
</div>

<p>

<!--
We have provided you with a multithreaded test case, 
<a href="TransactionTest.java"></a> that
creates a number of threads, with each thread running a single transaction
that reads and updates the database.  
-->

<h3> 2.8. Deadlocks and Aborts</h3>

It is possible for transactions in SimpleDB to deadlock (if you do not
understand why, we recommend reading about deadlocks in Ramakrishnan & Gehrke).
You will need to detect this situation and throw a
<code>TransactionAbortedException</code>. 

<p>

There are many possible ways to detect deadlock. For example, you may
implement a simple timeout policy that aborts a transaction if it has not
completed after a given period of time. Alternately, you may implement
cycle-detection in a dependency graph data structure. In this scheme, you
would check for cycles in a dependency graph whenever you attempt to grant
a new lock, and abort something if a cycle exists.

<p>

After you have detected that a deadlock exists, you must decide how to
improve the situation. Assume you have detected a deadlock while
transaction <code>t</code> is waiting for a lock.  If you're feeling
homicidal, you might abort <b>all</b> transactions that <code>t</code> is
waiting for; this may result in a large amount of work being undone, but
you can guarantee that <code>t</code> will make progress.

<p>

Alternately, you may decide to abort <code>t</code> to give other
transactions a chance to make progress. This means that the end-user will have
to retry transaction <code>t</code>.

<p>

<div class="exercise"><b>Exercise 5.</b>

  Implement deadlock detection and resolution in
  <code>src/simpledb/BufferPool.java</code>. Most likely, you will want to check
  for deadlock whenever a transaction attempts to acquire a lock and finds another
  transaction is holding the lock (note that this by itself is not a deadlock, but may
  be symptomatic of one.)  You have many design
  decisions for your deadlock resolution system, but it is not necessary to
  do something complicated. Please describe your choices in your writeup.

  <p>

  You should ensure that your code aborts transactions properly when a
  deadlock occurs, by throwing a
  <code>TransactionAbortedException</code> exception.
  This exception will be caught by the code executing the transaction
(e.g., <code>TransactionTest.java</code>), which should call
<code>transactionComplete()</code> to cleanup after the transaction.
  You are not expected to automatically restart a transaction which
  fails due to a deadlock -- you can assume that higher level code
  will take care of this.

  <p>

  We have provided some (not-so-unit) tests in
  <code>test/simpledb/DeadlockTest.java</code>. They are actually a
  bit involved, so they make take more than a few seconds to run (depending
  on your policy). If they seem to hang indefinitely, then you probably
  have an unresolved deadlock. These tests construct simple deadlock
  situations that your code should be able to escape.

  <p>

  Note that there are two timing parameters near the top of
  <code>DeadLockTest.java</code>; these determine the frequency at which
  the test checks if locks have been acquired and the waiting time before
  an aborted transaction is restarted. You may observe different
  performance characteristics by tweaking these parameters if you use a
  timeout-based detection method. The tests will output
  <code>TransactionAbortedExceptions</code> corresponding to resolved
  deadlocks to the console.

  <p>

  Your code should now should pass the TransactionTest system test (which may also
  run for quite a long time).

  <p> At this point, you should have a recoverable database, in the
sense that if the database system crashes (at a point other than
<code>transactionComplete()</code>) or if the user explicitly aborts a
transaction, the effects of any running transaction will not be visible
after the system restarts (or the transaction aborts.) You may wish to
verify this by running some transactions and explicitly killing the
database server.


</div>

<h3> 2.9. Design alternatives </h3>

During the course of this lab, we have identified three substantial design
choices that you have to make:

<ul>
<li> Locking granularity: page-level versus tuple-level
<li> Deadlock detection: timeouts versus dependency graphs
<li> Deadlock resolution: aborting yourself versus aborting others
</ul>

<div class="exercise"><b>Bonus Exercise 6. (10% extra credit)</b>

  For one or more of these choices, implement both alternatives and
  briefly compare their performance characteristics in your writeup.

  <p>

  You have now completed this lab. 
  Good work!
</div>

<h2> 3. Logistics </h2>

You must submit your code (see below) as well as a short (2 pages, maximum)
writeup describing your approach.  This writeup should:

<ul>

<li> Describe any design decisions you made, including your deadlock detection
policy, locking granularity, etc.

<li> Discuss and justify any changes you made to the API.

</ul>

<h3> 3.1. Collaboration </h3>

This lab should be manageable for a single person, but if you prefer
to work with a partner, this is also OK.  Larger groups are not allowed.
Please indicate clearly who you worked with, if anyone, on your writeup.  

<h3> 3.2. Submitting your assignment </h3>

<p>

To submit your code, please create a <tt>6.830-lab3.tar.gz</tt> tarball (such
that, untarred, it creates a <tt>6.830-lab3/src/simpledb/</tt> directory with
your code) and email it to <a
href="mailto:6830-submit@nms.csail.mit.edu">6830-submit@nms.csail.mit.edu</a>.
You may submit your code multiple times; we will use the latest version you
that arrives before the submission deadline (before class on the due date).
If applicable, please indicate your partner in your email.  Please also attach
your writeup as a PDF or text file.

<a name="bugs"></a>
<h3> 3.3. Submitting a bug </h3>

Please submit (friendly!) bug reports to <a
href="mailto:6830-bugs@nms.csail.mit.edu">6830-bugs@nms.csail.mit.edu</a>.
When you do, please try to include:

<ul>

<li>A description of the bug.

<li>A <tt>.java</tt> file we can drop in the <code>src/simpledb/test</code>
directory, compile, and run.

<li>A <tt>.txt</tt> file with the data that reproduces the bug.  We should be
able to convert it to a <tt>.dat</tt> file using <code>PageEncoder</code>.

</ul>

If you are the first person to report a particular bug in the code, we will
give you a candy bar!

<a name="grading"></a>
<h3> 3.4 Grading </h3>

<p>50% of your grade will be based on whether or not your code passes the
system test suite we will run over it. These tests will be a superset
of the tests we have provided. Before handing in your code, you should
make sure produces no errors (passes all of the tests) from both
<tt>ant test</tt> and <tt>ant systemtest</tt>.</p>

<p>

<b>Important:</b> before testing, we will replace your <tt>build.xml</tt>,
<tt>HeapFileEncoder.java</tt>, and the entire contents of the
<tt>test/</tt> directory with our version of these files!  This
means you cannot change the format of <tt>.dat</tt> files!  You should
therefore be careful changing our APIs. This also means you need to test
whether your code compiles with our test programs. In other words, we will
untar your tarball, replace the files mentioned above, compile it, and then
grade it. It will look roughly like this:

<pre>
$ gunzip 6.830-lab3.tar.gz
$ tar xvf 6.830-lab3.tar
$ cd 6.830-lab3
[replace build.xml, HeapFileEncoder.java, and test]
$ ant test
$ ant systemtest
[additional tests]
</pre>

If any of these commands fail, we'll be unhappy, and, therefore, so will your grade.

<p>

An additional 50% of your grade will be based on the quality of your
writeup and our subjective evaluation of your code.

<p>

We've had a lot of fun designing this assignment, and we hope you enjoy
hacking on it!
