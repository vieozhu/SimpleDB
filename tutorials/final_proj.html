    <h1>6.830 Final Project Assignment and Ideas (Fall 2009)</h1>

<b>Important Dates:   <ul>
<li> 10/15: Project Proposals Due
<li> 12/10: Project Presentations and Final Reports Due
</ul>
</b>

<p>  

A large portion (20%) of your grade in 6.830 consists of a final project.
This project is meant to be a substantial independent research or
engineering effort related to material we have studied in class.  Your
project may involve a comparison of systems we have read about, an
application of database techniques to a system you are familiar with,
or be a database-related project in your research area.
<p>
This document describes what is expected of a final project and 
proposes some possible project ideas. 

<h2> What is Expected </h2>

Good class projects can vary dramatically in complexity, scope, and topic.
The only requirement is that they be related to something we have studied
in this class and that they contain some element of research -- e.g., that
you do more than simply engineer a piece of software that someone else
has described or architected.  To help you determine if your idea is of
reasonable scope, we will arrange to meet with each group several times
throughout the semester.

<h3> What to Hand In </h3>
There are two written deliverables: a project proposal, due on October 15th,
and a final report, due on December 10th.
<p>
<b>Project Proposal</b>: The proposal should consist of 1-2 pages
describing the problem you plan to solve, outlining how you plan to
solve it, and describing what you will "deliver" for the final
project.  We will arrange short meetings with every group before the
project proposal to help you refine your topic and would be happy to 
provide feedback on a draft of your proposal before it is due.
<p>

<b>Final Report</b>: You should prepare a conference-style report on
your project with maximum length of 15 pages (10 pt font or larger,
one or two columns, 1 inch margins, single or double spaced -- more is not
better.)  Your report should introduce and motivate the problem your
project addresses, describe related work in the area, discuss the
elements of your solution, and present results that measure the
behavior, performance, or functionality of your system (with
comparisons to other related systems as appropriate.)
<p>
Because this report is the primary deliverable upon which you will
be graded, <b>do not treat it as an afterthought</b>.  Plan to leave
at least a week to do the writing, and make sure your proofread and 
edit carefully!
<p>
Please submit a paper copy of your report in class on Thursday, 12/10.
You will also be expected to give a presentation on your
project in class that will provide an opportunity for you to present
a short demo of your work and show what you have done to other students
in the class.  Details about the format of the presentation
will be posted as the date gets closer.

<h2> Project Ideas </h2>

The following is a list of possible project ideas;  you are not
required to choose from this list -- in fact, we encourage you
to try to solve a problem of your own choosing!  If you are interested
in working on one of these projects, contact Professor Madden or Professor Morris and we 
can put you in touch with students and others around MIT working on these
ideas.  Note that these are not meant to be complete project proposals, but
just suggestions for areas to explore -- you will need to flesh them out
into complete projects by talking with your group members, the course staff,
and graduate students working on these projects.

<ol>

<li> Access Methods for in-memory databases.The goal of this project
  is to study the trade-offs of various data representation options
  for databases in main memory. For example, in the <a
   href="javascript:if(confirm('http://db.cs.yale.edu/hstore/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://db.cs.yale.edu/hstore/'" tppabs="http://db.cs.yale.edu/hstore/">H-store Project</a> we found
  that using an array for in-memory tables with "dense" keys is good;
  one idea for a project would be to characterize the the cases where
  such arrays are beneficial.  Another would be to study in-memory
  compression, which might improve cache performance. (Contact Evan
  Jones for more information.)

  
  <li> Partition-aware object-relational mapping. Many programmers
  seem to prefer object-relational mapping (ORM) layers such as like
  <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.rubyonrails.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.rubyonrails.org/'" tppabs="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> or <a
   href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.hibernate.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.hibernate.org/'" tppabs="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a> to a traditional
  ODBC/JDBC interface to a database. In the <a
   href="javascript:if(confirm('http://db.cs.yale.edu/hstore/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://db.cs.yale.edu/hstore/'" tppabs="http://db.cs.yale.edu/hstore/">H-store Project</a> we have
  been studying performance benefits that can be obtained in a
  "partitonable" database, where the tables can be cleanly partitioned
  according to some key attribute (for example,
  <code>customer-id</code>), and queries are generally run over just
  one partition.  The goal of this project would be to study how to
  exploit partitioning to improve the performance of a distributed ORM
  layer. 

  
<li> Specialized storage layers.  Design a new database access method optimized for a particular
type of data.  For example, you could build a SimpleDB or MySQL access
method that is especially optimized for storing graphs, or for storing
arrays, and compare its performance the basic access methods we have
provided.  </li>

<li> Client-side database.  Build a Javascript library that client-side Web applications can
use to access a database; the idea is to avoid the painful way in
which current client-side application have to use the <a
 href="javascript:if(confirm('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest'" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest">XMLHttpRequest</a>
interface to access server-side objects asynchronously.  This layer
should cache objects on the client side whenever possible, but be
backed by a shared, server-side database system.
</li>

<li> As a related project, HTML5 browsers
(including WebKit, used by Safari and Chrome), include a <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://webkit.org/blog/126/webkit-does-html5-client-side-database-storage/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://webkit.org/blog/126/webkit-does-html5-client-side-database-storage/'" tppabs="http://webkit.org/blog/126/webkit-does-html5-client-side-database-storage/">client-side SQL API</a> in JavaScript.
This project would involve investigating how to user such a database to improve client performance, offload work from the server, etc.

</li>

<li> Preventing denial-of-service attacks on database systems.
Databases are a vulnerable point in many web sites, because it is
often possible for attackers to make some simple request that causes
the website to issue queries asking the database to do a lot of work.
By issuing a large number of such requests, and attacker can
effectively issue a denial of service attack against the web site by
disabling the database.  The goal of this project would be to develop 
a set of techniques to counter
this problem -- for example, one approach might be to modify the database scheduler
so that it doesn't run the same expensive queries over and over. </li>

<li> Auto-admin tools to recommend indices, etc.  Design a tool that
recommends a set of indices to build given a particular workload and a
set of statistics in a database.  Alternatively investigate the
question of which materialized views to create in a data-warehousing
system, such as <ahref="http://db.csail.mit.edu/projects/cstore">C-Store</a>.
</li>

<li> A related (more theoretical) project is to look at what
properties of transactions would simplify concurrency control and
recovery.  The simple example of this is that if all transactions are
read only, no concurrency control is needed.  But there are a variety
of other situations -- see <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://db.csail.mit.edu/pubs/vldb-07-hstore-final.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://db.csail.mit.edu/pubs/vldb-07-hstore-final.pdf'" tppabs="http://db.csail.mit.edu/pubs/vldb-07-hstore-final.pdf"> a
recent paper from the database group</a> on this topic.  The goal of
this project would be to think of additional properties and to try to
deduce algorithms that automatically determine what properties a
collection of transactions have.
</li>

<li> Asynchronous Database Access. Client software interacts with
standard SQL databases via a blocking interface like ODBC or JDBC; the
client sends SQL, waits for the database to process the query, and
receives an answer.  A non-blocking interface would allow a single
client thread to issue many parallel queries from the same thread,
with potential for some impressive performance gains.  This project
would investigate how this would work (do the queries have to be in
different transactions?  what kind of modification would need to be
made to the database) and would look at the possible performance gains
in some typical database benchmarks or applications.
</li>


<li> Heuristic Optimizer.  The Selinger Optimizer (see "Access Path Selection in a
Relational Database Management System" in the Red Book) is notoriously
bad at making query optimization decisions when there are many joins
because the statistics it computes over intermediate results are often
wrong.  Your goal for this project is to devise a scheme for
evaluating joins that doesn't require such detailed statistics -- for
example, by partitioning the query plan into several smaller groups of
joins that can be computed independently, and then using statistics
collected during the computation of those joins to join the remaining
intermediate relations.  Of course, this won't be "optimal", but your
goal should be to show that your scheme avoids making <b>very bad</b>
decisions and can in-fact outperform Selinger in some situations.
</li>

<li> Extend SimpleDB.  SimpleDB is very simple.  There are a number of ways you might
extend it to explore some of the research ideas we have studied in
this class.  For example, you could add support for optimistic
concurrency control and compare its performance to the basic
concurrency control scheme you will implement in Problem Set 3. 
There are a number of other possible projects of this type; 
we would be happy to discuss these in more detail.
</li>

<li> CarTel.  In the <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://cartel.csail.mit.edu/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://cartel.csail.mit.edu/'" tppabs="http://cartel.csail.mit.edu/">CarTel</a> project,
we are building a system for collecting and managing data from
automobiles.  There are several possible CarTel related projects:

<ul>


<li> One of the features of CarTel is a GUI for browsing geo-spatial
data collected from cars.  We currently have a primitive interface
for retrieving parts of the data that are of interest, but 
developing a more sophisticated interface or query language
for browsing and exploring this data would make a great project.
</li>

<li>  One of the dangers with building a system like CarTel
is that it collects relatively sensitive personal information
about users location and driving habits.  Protecting
this information from casual browsers, insurance companies,
or other undesired users is important.  However, it is also
important to be able to combine different users data together
to do things like intelligent route planning or vehicle
anomaly detection.  The goal of this project would be to
find a way to securely perform certain types of aggregate
queries over CarTel data without exposing personally 
identifiable information.
</li>

<li> We have speed and position data from the last year for 30 taxi
cabs on the Boston streets.  Think of something exciting you could do with 
this ....
</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>RDF data browser.  Build a tool that visualizes a graph of RDF
data and allows browsing and / or filtering of it.  This could include
efforts to deduce partial integrity constraints ("almost every book
has an author") as well as to generate wide (more relational)
representations from RDF triples.
</li>

<li>SPARQL to SQL conversion.  SPARQL is a RDF query language; this
project would look at converting it to SQL for execution on RDF data
stored in a relational format (see <a
href="javascript:if(confirm('http://db.csail.mit.edu/pubs/rdf.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://db.csail.mit.edu/pubs/rdf.pdf'" tppabs="http://db.csail.mit.edu/pubs/rdf.pdf">this paper</a> for a discussion as to
why storing RDF data in an RDBMS might be beneficial from a
performance perspective.)  It may be possible to leverage work from the
open source <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://jena.sourceforge.net/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://jena.sourceforge.net/'" tppabs="http://jena.sourceforge.net/">Jena</a> tool for this project.
</li>


<li>Integrity Constraints in Streaming Systems. Current stream data
processing systems (for example, <a
href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.cs.brown.edu/research/borealis/public/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.cs.brown.edu/research/borealis/public/'" tppabs="http://www.cs.brown.edu/research/borealis/public/">Borealis</a>)
do not provide any way for users to specify constraints on the data
that they can handle -- for example, a financial analysis application
might want to verify that no purchases exceed some available
balance. This project would involve defining what such constraints
mean, and exploring ways to efficiently check and react to them.  For
more information, see, for example, StreamClean (<a href="
javascript:if(confirm('http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/magda/mobide06.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/magda/mobide06.pdf'" tppabs="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/magda/mobide06.pdf">PDF</a>).
</li>

<li> Use a database to log and recover a file system.  This project would involve
using a database to implement transactions in a file system.  The idea would be to
use a user-level file-system package like <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://fuse.sourceforge.net/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://fuse.sourceforge.net/'" tppabs="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/">FUSE</a>
to intercept calls to read and write from the file system, and to log these actions to
a database to support ideas like transactions and rollback of the file system.
</li>

<li> Rollback of long-running or committed transactions.  Database systems typically only
support UNDO of committed transactions, but there are cases where it might be important
to rollback already committed transactions.
One approach is to use user-supplied <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.sigmod.org/vldb/conf/1990/P095.PDF  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.sigmod.org/vldb/conf/1990/P095.PDF'" tppabs="http://www.sigmod.org/vldb/conf/1990/P095.PDF">compensating actions</a>,
but there may be other models that are possible, or it may be possible to automatically derive such
compensating action for certain classes of transactions.  </li>

<li> Cloud database on Amazon EC2.  <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/'" tppabs="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> is a hosted cloud computing
service.  We have a number of credits available for use of these machines.  One possible project would involve building
a database system that runs in the cloud, looking at issues such as elasticity (e.g., adding or removing new machines
on the fly), fault tolerance, and load balancing.</li>

<li> SQL on Hadoop or Hadoop on SQL.  <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://hadoop.apache.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://hadoop.apache.org/'" tppabs="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> is an open source implementation of MapReduce.
Possible projects include using Hadoop to schedule SQL tasks, or extending the SimpleDB execution
engine to issue Hadoop jobs that run a database query in parallel.</li>
