	<title> Lab 2 Clarification about Table Names</title>
	<description>
	In Lab 2, your implementation of "addTable()" has particular constraints 
	when called twice with the same table name.  The wording in the lab document
	is a little bit unclear, so, to clarify:  If two tables are added by name,
	both must be stored within the database; but if you try to access the table
	by name (rather than by ID), the more-recently-added table will be used.

	A version of Lab 2 was published that indicated that the lab was due before class on Thursday.  This is incorrect; the lab is due by the end of the day (11:59pm) on Thursday.

<title>Running the parser</title>
<description>
The instructions for running the parser in lab2.html don't work.  
We accidentally stripped the parser code out of SimpleDB.java before shipping lab1.  
You can download the fixed SimpleDb.java from &lt;a href="http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/SimpleDb.java">here&lt;/a>, or
patch it as follows:
&lt;p>

In SimpleDb.java, after the else-if block:

&lt;pre>
        } else if (args[0].equals("print")) {
		...
	}
&lt;/pre>

You should add:

&lt;pre>
        else if (args[0].equals("parser")) {
            // Strip the first argument and call the parser
            String[] newargs = new String[args.length-1];
            for (int i = 1; i &lt; args.length; ++i) {
                newargs[i-1] = args[i];
            }
            Parser.main(newargs);
        }
&lt;/pre>

This goes just before the code:

&lt;pre>
	else { 
             System.err.println("Unknown command: " + args[0]); 
             System.exit(1); 
        } 
&lt;/pre>

&lt;p>
Alternatively, rather than patching or updating SimpleDB.java, you can run the parser directly 
from the command-line by typing (from the top-level simpledb directory):
&lt;pre>
java -classpath bin/src/:lib/jline-0.9.94.jar:lib/sql4j.jar:lib/zql.jar Parser catalog.txt
&lt;/pre>
where catalog.txt is the name of the catalog file describing the schema of the tables you wish to query (as described
in &lt;a href="http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/assignments/lab2.html#parser">Section 2.7 of lab2.html&lt;/a>).

        <title> Lab 1 version inconsistency </title>
        <description>
          Over the past few days, we inadvertently posted links to an old version of lab 1 (from 2008) on this RSS feed.  The link in the lab1.html file was correct, and the links from this feed have now been corrected.  However, some of you may have downloaded and begun working the 2008 version of the lab 1 code.  Here's what this means to you:
&lt;p>
          1) If you have not yet started lab 1, please re-download the &lt;a href="http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/assignments/6.830-lab1.tar.gz"> lab tarball &lt;/a>
&lt;p>
          2) If you have already started lab 1, you don't need to replace the version of the code you have.  However, if you are working with the 2008 version of the code, the  
&lt;a href="http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/assignments/lab1.html"> 2009 Lab 1 description &lt;/a>  is slightly incorrect in its description of the HeapFile/HeapPage format (we changed the format of HeapFiles between the two years).  To determine if you have the old version of the code, have a look at HeapPage.java.  If the constructor for HeapPage has a comment that looks like the code shown below, you have the old version of the lab.
&lt;p>

&lt;pre>
    /**
     * Constructor.
     * Construct the HeapPage from a set of bytes of data read from disk.
     * The format of a HeapPage is a set of 32-bit header words indicating
     * the slots of the page that are in use, plus (BufferPool.PAGE_SIZE/tuple
     * size) tuple slots, where tuple size is the size of tuples in this
     * database table
     * (which can be determined via a call to getTupleDesc in Catalog.)
     *
     * The number of 32-bitheader words is equal to:
     * 
     * (no. tuple slots / 32) + 1
     * 
     * @see Database#getCatalog
     * @see Catalog#getTupleDesc
     * @see BufferPool#PAGE_SIZE
     */
    public HeapPage(HeapPageId id, byte[] data) throws IOException {
&lt;/pre>

&lt;p>
In contrast, the 2009 version of the lab has the following comment before the HeapPage constructor:
&lt;p>

&lt;pre>
    /**
     * Create a HeapPage from a set of bytes of data read from disk.
     * The format of a HeapPage is a set of header bytes indicating
     * the slots of the page that are in use, some number of tuple slots.
     *  Specifically, the number of tuples is equal to: 
     *
     *          floor((BufferPool.PAGE_SIZE*8) / (tuple size * 8 + 1))
     *
     *  where tuple size is the size of tuples in this
     * database table, which can be determined via {@link Catalog#getTupleDesc}.
     * The number of 8-bit header words is equal to:
     * 
     *      ceiling(no. tuple slots / 8)
     * 
     * @see Database#getCatalog
     * @see Catalog#getTupleDesc
     * @see BufferPool#PAGE_SIZE
     */
    public HeapPage(HeapPageId id, byte[] data) throws IOException {
&lt;/pre>

&lt;p>  These comments illustrate the most significant differences between the HeapFile format in the two versions of the lab.
&lt;p>
In the
event that you do have the old 2008 version, you should refer to the
 &lt;a href="http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/assignments/lab1-2008.html"> 2008 Lab 1 description &lt;/a> when working through the lab.
The only section which is substantially different is 2.5., regarding the format of the HeapFile access method. 
&lt;p>
If you choose to submit the 2008 lab, we will grade it with the test cases from 2008, and you won't be penalized in any way.  
&lt;p>
We are sorry for this complication.  Please let us know if you are confused or need help addressing this issue.

        <title> Minor correction to lab1 build.xml file </title>
        <description>
	It turns out that the build.xml file of the first version of lab1 had a typo. If you downloaded the tarball
	before Monday, Sep 28 your build.xml might have this issue. Line 84 of the build.xml file should have value="SimpleDb"
	instead of value="simpledb". Please check your file for this typo. You can either	
	
        &lt;ul> &lt;li> Download the &lt;a href="http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/assignments/6.830-lab1.tar.gz"> new tarball &lt;/a> (posted 9/27, 11:45 PM) or
                &lt;li> Download the &lt;a href="http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/assignments/build.xml"> corrected build.xml &lt;/a> or
                &lt;li> Download the patch &lt;a href="http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/lab1-build.xml.patch.gz"> lab1-build.xml.patch.gz &lt;/a> and apply it by &lt;br>
                        &lt;code> ~/path/to/6.830-lab1 $ patch -p1 -i lab1-build.xml.patch &lt;/code> or
                &lt;li> Manually edit the build.xml file and replace "simpledb" with "SimpleDb" on line 84.

      <title>Q6 in PS1 Changed</title>
      <description>
	There was a bit of an ambiguity in the statement of Q6. We changed it to look like this:
        "Find the top 10 managers who have given the most number of grants to a single PI."
	We basically want you to find the top 10 managers, when we list the managers according to the number of grants
	they have given to a single PI.

      <title>Course Mailing Lists </title>
      <description> We've created two mailing lists for the course, &lt;a href="https://mailman.mit.edu:444/mailman/listinfo/6830-disucss">6830-discuss@mit.edu&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://mailman.mit.edu:444/mailman/listinfo/6830-announce">6830-announce@mit.edu&lt;/a>.  We will add you to these lists automatically when you sign up at the first class, but if you miss class you can request to be added manually using the links above (MIT certificates are required to access these lists).  Please use the discuss list for any class related discussion (e.g., questions about labs or problem sets);  we will post important class messages on the announce list (it will be very low traffic, so please don't unsubscribe!)
