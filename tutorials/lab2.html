    <h1>6.830 Lab 2: SimpleDB Operators</h1>

<b>Assigned: Friday, October 2, 2009</b><br>
<b>Due: Thursday, October 15, 2009</b>

<p>

Version History:

<ul>
<li> 10/2/09 : Initial version
</ul>

<p>

In this lab assignment, you will write a set of operators for SimpleDB
to implement table modifications (e.g., insert and delete records),
selections, joins, and aggregates. These will build on top of the
foundation that you wrote in Lab 1 to provide you with a database
system that can perform simple queries over multiple tables.

<p>

Additionally, we ignored the issue of buffer pool management in Lab 1; we
have not dealt with the problem that arises when we reference more pages 
than we can fit in memory over the lifetime of the database. 
In Lab 2, you will design an eviction policy to
flush stale pages from the buffer pool.

<p>

You do not need to implement transactions or locking in this lab.

<p>

The remainder of this document gives some suggestions about how to start
coding, describes a set of exercises to help you work through the lab, 
and discusses how to hand in your code. This lab requires you to
write a fair amount of code, so we encourage you to start early!

<h2> 0.  Find bugs, be patient, earn candy bars </h2>

<p>SimpleDB is a relatively complex piece of code.
It is very possible you are going to find bugs, inconsistencies, and bad,
outdated, or incorrect documentation, etc.</p>

<p>We ask you, therefore, to do this lab with an adventurous mindset.  Don't get
mad if something is not clear, or even wrong; rather, try to figure it out
yourself or send us a friendly email.  We promise to help out by posting
bug fixes, new tarballs, etc., as bugs and issues are reported.
<!--which you can find <a href="bugs.html">here</a>.</p>-->

<p>...and if you find a bug in our code, we'll give you a candy bar (see <a
href="#bugs">Section 3.3</a>)!</p>


<h2><a name="starting"> 1. Getting started </h2>

You should begin with the code you submitted for Lab 1 (if you did not
submit code for Lab 1, or your solution didn't work properly, contact us to
discuss options.)  We have provided you with extra test cases for this lab
that are not in the original code distribution you received. We reiterate
that the unit tests we provide are to help guide your implementation along,
but they are not intended to be comprehensive or to establish correctness.

<p>

You will need to add these new test cases to your release. The easiest way
to do this is to untar the new code in the same directory as your top-level
simpledb directory, as follows:

<ul>

<li>Make a backup of your Lab 1 solution by typing :
<pre>$ tar -cvzf 6.830-lab1-submitted.tar.gz 6.830-lab1</pre>

<li>Change to the directory that contains your top-level simpledb
code:
<pre>
$ cd 6.830-lab1
</pre>

<li>

Download the new tests and skeleton code for Lab 2 from <a
href="6.830-lab2-supplement.tar.gz" tppabs="http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/6.830-lab2-supplement.tar.gz">
http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/6.830-lab2-supplement.tar.gz</a>:
<pre>
$ wget <a href="6.830-lab2-supplement.tar.gz" tppabs="http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/6.830-lab2-supplement.tar.gz">http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/6.830-lab2-supplement.tar.gz</a>
</pre>

<li>Extract the new files for Lab 2 by typing:

<pre>tar -xvzf 6.830-lab2-supplement.tar.gz</pre>

<!-- The only existing files that this will overwrite are:
  <ul>
  <li> <code>grader.pl</code>
  <li> <code>src/simpledb/Aggregate.java</code>
  <li> <code>src/simpledb/Aggregator.java</code>
  <li> <code>src/simpledb/IntAggregator.java</code>
  <li> <code>src/simpledb/unittest/HeapFileTest.java</code>
  <li> <code>src/simpledb/unittest/HeapPageTest.java</code>
  <li> <code>src/simpledb/unittest/Utility.java</code>
  </ul>

<p>

Please be sure to back up any changes you've made to the existing files.
Otherwise, the supplement fixes a design issue with SimpleDB aggregates and
it will add tests to your code repository.  
-->

<li><b>Eclipse users</b> will have to take one more step for their code to compile.
Under the package explorer, right click the project name (probably <tt>6.830-lab1</tt>),
and select <b>Properties</b>.  Choose <b>Java Build Path</b> on the left-hand-side,
and click on the <b>Libraries</b> tab on the right-hand-side.  Push the <b>Add JARs...</b>
button, select <b>zql.jar</b> and <b>jline-0.9.94.jar</b>, and push <b>OK</b>, followed by
<b>OK</b>.  Your code should now compile.
</ul>

<p>

<h3> 1.3. Implementation hints </h3>


<p>

As before, we <b>strongly encourage</b> you to read through this entire
document to get a feel for the high-level design of SimpleDB before you
write code. 

<p>

We suggest exercises along this document to guide your implementation, but
you may find that a different order makes more sense for you.  As before,
we will grade your assignment by looking at your code and verifying that
you have passed the test for the ant targets <code>test</code> and
<code>systemtest</code>.  See Section 3.4 for a complete discussion of
grading and list of the tests you will need to pass.<p>

Here's a rough outline of one way you might proceed with your SimpleDB
implementation;  more details on the steps in this outline, including
exercises, are given in Section 2 below.

<ul>

<li> Implement the operators <code>Filter</code> and <code>Join</code> and
verify that their corresponding tests work. The Javadoc comments for
these operators contain details about how they should work.  We have given you implementations of
  <code>Project</code> and <code>OrderBy</code> which may help you
  understand how other operators work.

<li> Implement <code>IntAggregator</code> and <code>StringAggregator</code>. Here, you will write the
logic that actually computes an aggregate over a particular field across
multiple groups in a sequence of input tuples. Use integer division for
computing the average, since SimpleDB only supports integers. StringAggegator
only needs to support the COUNT aggregate, since the other operations do not
make sense for strings.  

<li> Implement the <code>Aggregate</code> operator.  As with other
operators, aggregates implement the <code>DbIterator</code> interface
so that they can be placed in SimpleDB query plans.  Note that the
output of an <code>Aggregate</code> operator is an aggregate value of an
entire group for each call to <code>next()</code>, and that the
aggregate constructor takes the aggregation and grouping fields.

<li> Implement the methods related to tuple insertion, deletion, and page
eviction in <code>BufferPool</code>. You do not need to worry about
transactions at this point.

<li> Implement the <code>Insert</code> and <code>Delete</code> operators.
Like all operators,  <code>Insert</code> and <code>Delete</code> implement
<code>DbIterator</code>, accepting a stream of tuples to insert or delete
and outputting a single tuple with an integer field that indicates the
number of tuples inserted or deleted.  These operators will need to call
the appropriate methods in <code>BufferPool</code> that actually modify the
 pages on disk.  Check that the tests for inserting and
deleting tuples work properly.  
<p>

Note that SimpleDB does not implement any kind of consistency or integrity
checking, so it is possible to insert duplicate records into a file and
there is no way to enforce primary or foreign key constraints.

</ul>

At this point you should be able to pass all of the tests in the ant
  <code>systemtest</code> target, which is the goal of this lab.

  <p>

  You'll also be able to use the provided SQL parser to run SQL
  queries against your database!  See <a href="#parser">Section 2.7</a> for a
  brief tutorial and a description of an optional contest to see who can write
  the fastest SimpleDB implementation.

</p>

<p>
Finally, you might notice that the iterators in this lab extend the
AbstractDbIterator class instead of implementing the DbIterator
interface.  Because the implementation of <tt>next</tt>/<tt>hasNext</tt>
is often repetitive, annoying, and error-prone, AbstractDbIterator
implements this logic generically, and only requires that you implement
a simpler <tt>readNext</tt>.  Feel free to use this style of
implementation, or just implement the DbIterator interface if you prefer.
To implement the DbIterator interface, remove <b>extends AbstractDbIterator</b>
from iterator classes, and in its place put <b>implements DbIterator</b>.
</p>


<h2> 2. SimpleDB Architecture and Implementation Guide </h2>


<h3> 2.1. Filter and Join </h3>

Recall that SimpleDB DbIterator classes implement the operations of the
relational algebra. You will now implement two operators that will enable
you to perform queries that are slightly more interesting than a table
scan.

<ul>

<li><i>Filter</i>: This operator only returns tuples that satisfy
a <code>Predicate</code> that is specified as part of its constructor. Hence,
it filters out any tuples that do not match the predicate.

<li><i>Join</i>: This operator joins tuples from its two children according to
a <code>JoinPredicate</code> that is passed in as part of its constructor.
We only require a simple nested loops join, but you may explore more
interesting join implementations. Describe your implementation in your lab
writeup.

</ul>

<div class="exercise"><b>Exercise 1.</b>

  Implement the skeleton methods in:
  <ul>
  <li> <tt>src/simpledb/Predicate.java</tt>
  <li> <tt>src/simpledb/JoinPredicate.java</tt>
  <li> <tt>src/simpledb/Filter.java</tt>
  <li> <tt>src/simpledb/Join.java</tt>
  </ul>
  
  At this point, your code should pass the unit tests in
  PredicateTest, JoinPredicateTest, FilterTest, and JoinTest. Furthermore,
  you should be able to pass the system tests FilterTest and JoinTest.
</div>


<h3> 2.2. Aggregates </h3>

An additional SimpleDB operator implements basic SQL aggregates with a
<code>GROUP BY</code> clause. You should implement the five SQL aggregates
(<code>COUNT</code>, <code>SUM</code>, <code>AVG</code>, <code>MIN</code>,
<code>MAX</code>) and support grouping.  You only need to support aggregates
over a single field, and grouping by a single field. 

<p>

In order to calculate aggregates, we use an <code>Aggregator</code>
interface which merges a new tuple into the existing calculation of an
aggregate. The <code>Aggregator</code> is told during construction what
operation it should use for aggregation.  Subsequently, the client code
should call <code>Aggregator.merge()</code> for every tuple in the child
iterator. After all tuples have been merged, the client can retrieve a
DbIterator of aggregation results. Each tuple in the result is a pair of
the form <code>(groupValue, aggregateValue)</code>, unless the value
of the group by field was <code>Aggregator.NO_GROUPING</code>, in which
case the result is a single tuple of the form <code>(aggregateValue)</code>.

<p>

Note that this implementation requires space linear in the number of
distinct groups.  For the purposes of this lab, you do not need to worry
about the situation where the number of groups exceeds available memory.

<p> 

<div class="exercise"><b>Exercise 2.</b>

  Implement the skeleton methods in:
  <ul>
  <li> <tt>src/simpledb/IntAggregator.java</tt>
  <li> <tt>src/simpledb/StringAggregator.java</tt>
  <li> <tt>src/simpledb/Aggregate.java</tt>
  </ul>
  At this point, your code should pass the unit tests
  IntAggregatorTest, StringAggregatorTest, and
  AggregateTest. Furthermore, you should be able to pass the AggregateTest system test.
</div>


<h3> 2.3. HeapFile Mutability </h3>

Now, we will begin to implement methods to support modifying tables. We
begin at the level of individual pages and files.  There are two main sets
of operations:  adding tuples and removing tuples.
<p>
<b>Removing tuples:</b> To remove a tuple, you will need to implement
<code>deleteTuple</code>.
Tuples contain <code>RecordIDs</code> which allow you to find
the page they reside on, so this should be as simple as locating the page 
a tuple belongs to and modifying the headers of the page appropriately.
</p><p>
<b>Adding tuples:</b> The <code>addTuple</code> method in
<code>HeapFile.java</code> is responsible for adding a tuple to a heap
file.  To add a new tuple to a HeapFile, you will have to find a page with
an empty slot. If no such pages exist in the HeapFile, you
need to create a new page and append it to the physical file on disk.  You will
need to ensure that the RecordID in the tuple is updated correctly.</p>

<div class="exercise"><b>Exercise 3.</b>

  Implement the remaining skeleton methods in:
  <ul>
  <li> <tt>src/simpledb/HeapPage.java</tt>
  <!-- addTuple(), deleteTuple() and setSlot()-->
  <li> <tt>src/simpledb/HeapFile.java</tt> (note that you do not
    necessarily need to implement writePage at this point.)
  <!-- writePage(), addTuple(), deleteTuple() -->
  </ul>
  
  <p>

  To implement HeapPage, you will need to modify the header bitmap for
  methods such as <tt>addTuple()</tt> and <tt>deleteTuple()</tt>. You may
  find that the <tt>getNumEmptySlots()</tt> and <tt>getSlot()</tt> methods we asked you to
  implement in Lab 1 serve as useful abstractions.  Note that there is a
  <tt>setSlot</tt> method provided as an abstraction to modify the filled
  or cleared status of a tuple in the page header.

  <p>
   Note that it is important that the <tt>HeapFile.addTuple()</tt>
   and <tt>HeapFile.deleteTuple()</tt> methods access pages using
   the <tt>BufferPool.getPage()</tt> method; otherwise, your
   implementation of transactions in the next lab will not work
   properly.
 <p>

  Implement the following skeleton methods in <tt>src/simpledb/BufferPool.java</tt>:  
  <ul>
  <li> <tt>insertTuple()</tt>
  <li> <tt>deleteTuple()</tt>
  </ul>
    
  <p>
  These methods should call the appropriate methods in the HeapFile that
  belong to the table being modified (this extra level of indirection is
  needed to support other types of files &mdash; like indices &mdash; in the
  future).

  <p>

  At this point, your code should pass the unit tests in HeapPageWriteTest and
  HeapFileWriteTest. We have not provided additional unit tests for
  <code>HeapFile.deleteTuple()</code> or <code>BufferPool</code>.
</div>

<p> 


<h3> 2.4. Insertion and deletion </h3>

Now that you have written all of the HeapFile machinery to add and remove
tuples, you will implement the <code>Insert</code> and <code>Delete</code>
operators. 

<p>

For plans that implement <code>insert</code> and <code>delete</code> queries,
the top-most operator is a special <code>Insert</code> or <code>Delete</code>
operator that modifies the pages on disk.  These operators return the number
of affected tuples. This is implemented by returning a single tuple with one
integer field, containing the count.

<ul>

<li><i>Insert</i>: This operator adds the tuples it reads from its child
operator to the <code>tableid</code> specified in its constructor.  It should
use the <code>BufferPool.insertTuple()</code> method to do this.

<li><i>Delete</i>: This operator deletes the tuples it reads from its child
operator from the <code>tableid</code> specified in its constructor.  It
should use the <code>BufferPool.deleteTuple()</code> method to do this.

</ul>

<p> 

<div class="exercise"><b>Exercise 4.</b>

  Implement the skeleton methods in:
  <ul>
  <li> <tt>src/simpledb/Insert.java</tt>
  <li> <tt>src/simpledb/Delete.java</tt>
  </ul>

  At this point, your code should pass the unit tests in InsertTest. We
  have not provided unit tests for <code>Delete</code>. Furthermore, you
  should be able to pass  the InsertTest and DeleteTest system tests.
</div>


<h3> 2.5. Page eviction </h3>

In Lab 1, we did not correctly observe the limit on the maximum number of pages
in the buffer pool defined by the
constructor argument <code>numPages</code>. Now, you will choose a page eviction
policy and instrument any previous code that reads or creates pages to
implement your policy.

<p>

When more than <tt>numPages</tt> pages are in the buffer pool, one page should be
evicted from the pool before the next is loaded.  The choice of eviction
policy is up to you; it is not necessary to do something sophisticated.
Describe your policy in the lab writeup.

<p>

Notice that <code>BufferPool</code> asks you to implement
a <code>flushAllPages()</code> method.  This is not something you would ever
need in a real implementation of a buffer pool.  However, we need this method
for testing purposes. You should never call this method from any real code.

Because of the way we have implemented ScanTest.cacheTest, you will
need to ensure that your flushPage and flushAllPages methods
do no evict pages from the buffer pool to properly pass
this test.

flushAllPages should call flushPage on all pages in the BufferPool,
and flushPage should write any dirty page to disk and mark it as not
dirty, while leaving it in the BufferPool.

The only method which should remove page from the buffer pool is
evictPage, which should call flushPage on any dirty page it evicts.

<div class="exercise"><b>Exercise 5.</b>

  Fill in the <code>flushPage()</code> method and additional helper
  methods to implement page eviction in:
  <ul>
  <li> <tt>src/simpledb/BufferPool.java</tt>
  </ul>

  <p>

  If you did not implement <code>writePage()</code> in
  <tt>HeapFile.java</tt> above, you will also need to do that here.						 

  <p>

  At this point, your code should pass the EvictionTest system test.
  
  <p>Since we will not
  be checking for any particular eviction policy, this test works by creating a
  BufferPool with 16 pages (NOTE: while DEFAULT_PAGES is 50, we are initializing the
  BufferPool with less!), scanning a file with many more than 16 pages, and seeing
  if the memory usage of the JVM increases by more than 5 MB.  If you do not
  implement an eviction policy correctly, you will not evict enough pages, and will
  go over the size limitation, thus failing the test.
  <p>
</div>

<p>You have now completed this lab. Good work!</p>

<h3><a name="query_walkthrough">2.6. Query walkthrough</a></h3>

<p>

The following code implements a simple join query between two tables, each
consisting of three columns of integers.  (The file
<code>some_data_file1.dat</code> and <code>some_data_file2.dat</code> are
binary representation of the pages from this file). This code is equivalent
to the SQL statement:

<pre class="sh_sql">
SELECT * 
  FROM some_data_file1, some_data_file2 
  WHERE some_data_file1.field1 = some_data_file2.field1
  AND some_data_file1.id &gt; 1
</pre>

For more extensive examples of query operations, you may find it helpful to
browse the unit tests for joins, filters, and aggregates.
 
<pre class="sh_java">
package simpledb;
import java.io.*;

public class jointest {

    public static void main(String[] argv) {
        // construct a 3-column table schema
        Type types[] = new Type[]{ Type.INT_TYPE, Type.INT_TYPE, Type.INT_TYPE };
        String names[] = new String[]{ "field0", "field1", "field2" };

        TupleDesc td = new TupleDesc(types, names);

        // create the tables, associate them with the data files
        // and tell the catalog about the schema  the tables.
        HeapFile table1 = new HeapFile(new File("some_data_file1.dat"), td);
        Database.getCatalog().addTable(table1, "t1");

        HeapFile table2 = new HeapFile(new File("some_data_file2.dat"), td);
        Database.getCatalog().addTable(table2, "t2");

        // construct the query: we use two SeqScans, which spoonfeed
        // tuples via iterators into join
        TransactionId tid = new TransactionId();

        SeqScan ss1 = new SeqScan(tid, table1.getId(), "t1");
        SeqScan ss2 = new SeqScan(tid, table2.getId(), "t2");

        // create a filter for the where condition
        Filter sf1 = new Filter(
                                new Predicate(0,
                                Predicate.Op.GREATER_THAN, new IntField(1)),  ss1);

        JoinPredicate p = new JoinPredicate(1, Predicate.Op.EQUALS, 1);
        Join j = new Join(p, sf1, ss2);

        // and run it
        try {
            j.open();
            while (j.hasNext()) {
                Tuple tup = j.next();
                System.out.println(tup);
            }
            j.close();
            Database.getBufferPool().transactionComplete(tid);

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

    }

}</pre>

<p>

Both tables have three integer fields. To express this, we create
a <code>TupleDesc</code> object and pass it an array of <code>Type</code>
objects indicating field types and <code>String</code> objects
indicating field names. Once we have created this <code>TupleDesc</code>, we initialize
two <code>HeapFile</code> objects representing the tables.  Once we have
created the tables, we add them to the Catalog. (If this were a database
server that was already running, we would have this catalog information
loaded; we need to load this only for the purposes of this test).

<p>

Once we have finished initializing the database system, we create a query
plan.  Our plan consists of two <code>SeqScan</code> operators that scan
the tuples from each file on disk, connected to a <code>Filter</code>
operator on the first HeapFile, connected to a <code>Join</code> operator
that joins the tuples in the tables according to the
<code>JoinPredicate</code>.  In general, these operators are instantiated
with references to the appropriate table (in the case of SeqScan) or child
operator (in the case of e.g., Join). The test program then repeatedly
calls <code>next</code> on the <code>Join</code> operator, which in turn
pulls tuples from its children. As tuples are output from the
<code>Join</code>, they are printed out on the command line.

<h3><a name="parser">2.7. Query Parser and Contest</a></h3>

We've provided you with a query parser for SimpleDB that you can use
to write and run SQL queries against your database once you
have completed the exercises in this lab.
<p>
The first step is to create some data tables and a catalog.  Suppose
you have a file <code>data.txt</code> with the following contents:

<pre>
1,10
2,20
3,30
4,40
5,50
5,50
</pre>

You can convert this into a SimpleDB table using the
<code>convert</code> command (make sure to type <tt>ant</tt> first!):

<pre>
java -jar dist/simpledb.jar convert data.txt 2 "int,int"
</pre>

This creates a file <code>data.dat</code>. In addition to the table's
raw data, the two additional parameters specify that each record has
two fields and that their types are <code>int</code> and
<code>int</code>.

<p>

Next, create a catalog file, <code>catalog.txt</code>,
with the follow contents:

<pre>
data (f1 int, f2 int)
</pre>

This tells SimpleDB that there is one table, <code>data</code> (stored in
<code>data.dat</code>) with two integer fields named <code>f1</code>
and <code>f2</code>.
<p>
Finally, invoke the parser.
You must run java from the
command line (ant doesn't work properly with interactive targets.)
  From the <code>simpledb/</code> directory, type:

<pre>
java -jar dist/simpledb.jar parser catalog.txt
</pre>

You should see output like:

<pre>
Added table : data with schema INT(f1), INT(f2), 
SimpleDB> 
</pre>

Finally, you can run a query:

<pre>
SimpleDB> select d.f1, d.f2 from data d;
Started a new transaction tid = 1221852405823
 ADDING TABLE d(data) TO tableMap
     TABLE HAS  tupleDesc INT(d.f1), INT(d.f2), 
1       10
2       20
3       30
4       40
5       50
5       50

 6 rows.
----------------
0.16 seconds

SimpleDB> 
</pre>

The parser is relatively full featured (including support for SELECTs,
INSERTs, DELETEs, and transactions), but does have some problems
and does not necessarily report completely informative error
messages.  Here are some limitations to bear in mind:

<ul>
<li> You must preface every field name with its table name, even if
  the field name is unique (you can use table name aliases, as in the
  example above, but you cannot use the AS keyword.)
<p>
  <li> Nested queries are supported in the WHERE clause, but not the
 FROM clause.
  <p>
 <li> No arithmetic expressions are supported (for example, you can't
 take the sum of two fields.)
  <p>
 <li> At most one GROUP BY and one aggregate column are allowed.
  <p>
 <li> Set-oriented operators like IN, UNION, and EXCEPT are not
 allowed.<p>
  <li> Only AND expressions in the WHERE clause are allowed.<p>
  <li> UPDATE expressions are not supported.
  <p>
 <li> The string operator LIKE is allowed, but must be written out
 fully (that is, the Postgres tilde [~] shorthand is not allowed.) <p>
</ul>

<div class="exercise"><b>Contest (Optional)</b>

  <p>
  The first-place winner in the contest will receive a $50 gift certificate to Amazon.
  The second-place winner will receive a $25 gift certificate to Amazon.
  
  <p>
  We have built SimpleDB-encoded version of the NSF
  database you used in problem set 1; the needed files are located at: <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://db.csail.mit.edu/nsf_data.tar.gz  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://db.csail.mit.edu/nsf_data.tar.gz'" tppabs="http://db.csail.mit.edu/nsf_data.tar.gz">http://db.csail.mit.edu/nsf_data.tar.gz</a></p>

  <p>
  You should download the file and unpack it. It will create four files in the
  <code>nsf_data</code> directory. Move them into
  the <code>simpledb</code> directory. The following commands will acomplish
  this, if you run them from the <code>simpledb</code> directory:</p>
  
<pre>
wget http://db.csail.mit.edu/nsf_data.tar.gz
tar xvzf nsf_data.tar.gz
mv nsf_data/* .
rm -r nsf_data.tar.gz nsf_data
</pre>
  
  <p>You can then run the parser with:</p>

<pre>
java -jar dist/simpledb.jar parser nsf.schema
</pre>

  
  <p>

  We will give a prize to the submission that has shortest total runtime
  for the following three queries (where total runtime is the sum of
  the runtime of each of the individual queries):

  <p>
  <ol>
  <li><pre class="sh_sql" style="background: none;">
SELECT g.title
FROM grants g
WHERE g.title LIKE 'Monkey';
</pre></li>

  <li><pre class="sh_sql" style="background: none;">
SELECT g.title
FROM grants g, researchers r, grant_researchers gr
WHERE r.name = 'Samuel Madden'
AND gr.researcherid = r.id
AND gr.grantid = g.id;
 </pre></li>

  <li><pre class="sh_sql" style="background: none;">
SELECT r2.name, count(g.id)
FROM grants g, researchers r, researchers r2, grant_researchers gr,  grant_researchers gr2
WHERE r.name = 'Samuel Madden'
AND gr.researcherid = r.id
AND gr.grantid = g.id
AND gr2.researcherid = r2.id
AND gr.grantid = gr2.grantid
 GROUP BY r2.name
 ORDER BY r2.name;
 
</pre></li>
</ol>

  <p>

Note that each
  query will print out its runtime after it executes.
  <p>
  You may wish to create optimized implementations of some of the
  operators; in particular, a fast join operator (e.g., not nested
  loops) will be essential for good
  performance on queries 2 and 3.
  
  <p>
  There is currently no optimizer in the parser, so the queries above
  have been written to cause the parser generate reasonable plans.
  Here are some helpful hints about how the parser works that you may
  wish to exploit while running these queries:
  <ul>
    <li> The
  table on the left side of the joins in these queries is passed in as the first
 <code>DbIterator</code> parameter to <code>Join</code>.<p>
    <li> Expressions in the WHERE clause are added to the plan from top
  to bottom, such that first expression will be the bottom-most operator
  in the generated query plan.  For example, the generated plan for Query 2 is:
    <pre>Project(Join(Join(Filter(a),pa),p))</pre>
</ul>
  <p>
  Our reference implementation can run Query 1 in about .1 seconds,
  Query 2 in about .4 seconds, and
  Query 3 in about .7 seconds.  We implemented a special-purpose join
  operator for equality joins but did little else to optimize
  performance.

<h2> 3. Logistics </h2>

You must submit your code (see below) as well as a short (2 pages, maximum)
writeup describing your approach.  This writeup should:

<ul>

<li> Describe any design decisions you made, including your choice of page
  eviction policy. If you used something other than a nested-loops join,
  describe the tradeoffs of the algorithm you chose.

<li> Discuss and justify any changes you made to the API.

<li> Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

<li> Describe how long you spent on the lab, and whether there was anything
  you found particularly difficult or confusing.

</ul>

<h3> 3.1. Collaboration </h3>

This lab should be manageable for a single person, but if you prefer
to work with a partner, this is also OK.  Larger groups are not allowed.
Please indicate clearly who you worked with, if anyone, on your individual
writeup.  

<h3> 3.2. Submitting your assignment </h3>

<p>

To submit your code, please create a <tt>6.830-lab2.tar.gz</tt> tarball (such
that, untarred, it creates a <tt>6.830-lab2/src/simpledb</tt> directory with
your code) and email it to <a
href="mailto:6830-submit@nms.csail.mit.edu">6830-submit@nms.csail.mit.edu</a>.
You may submit your code multiple times; we will use the latest version you
submit that arrives before the deadline (before 11:59pm on the due date).  If
applicable, please indicate your partner in your email.  Please also attach
your individual writeup as a PDF or text file.

<a name="bugs"></a>
<h3> 3.3. Submitting a bug </h3>

Please submit (friendly!) bug reports to <a
href="mailto:6830-bugs@nms.csail.mit.edu">6830-bugs@nms.csail.mit.edu</a>.
When you do, please try to include:

<ul>

<li>A description of the bug.

<li>A <tt>.java</tt> file we can drop in the
<code>test/simpledb</code> directory, compile, and run.

<li>A <tt>.txt</tt> file with the data that reproduces the bug.  We should be
able to convert it to a <tt>.dat</tt> file using <code>HeapFileEncoder</code>.

</ul>

If you are the first person to report a particular bug in the code, we will
give you a candy bar!

<a name="grading"></a>
<h3> 3.4 Grading </h3>

<p>50% of your grade will be based on whether or not your code passes the
system test suite we will run over it. These tests will be a superset
of the tests we have provided. Before handing in your code, you should
make sure produces no errors (passes all of the tests) from both
<tt>ant test</tt> and <tt>ant systemtest</tt>.</p>

<p>

<b>Important:</b> before testing, we will replace your <tt>build.xml</tt>,
<tt>HeapFileEncoder.java</tt>, and the entire contents of the
<tt>test/</tt> directory with our version of these files!  This
means you cannot change the format of <tt>.dat</tt> files!  You should
therefore be careful changing our APIs. This also means you need to test
whether your code compiles with our test programs. In other words, we will
untar your tarball, replace the files mentioned above, compile it, and then
grade it. It will look roughly like this:

<pre>
$ gunzip 6.830-lab2.tar.gz
$ tar xvf 6.830-lab2.tar
$ cd ./6.830-lab2
[replace build.xml, HeapFileEncoder.java, and test]
$ ant test
$ ant systemtest
[additional tests]
</pre>

If any of these commands fail, we'll be unhappy, and, therefore, so will your grade.

<p>

An additional 50% of your grade will be based on the quality of your
writeup and our subjective evaluation of your code.

<p>

We've had a lot of fun designing this assignment, and we hope you enjoy
hacking on it!
