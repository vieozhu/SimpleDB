<h1>6.830 / 6.814: Syllabus 2009</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>

This course is designed to introduce graduate students to the foundations of
database systems, focusing on basics such as the relational algebra and data
model, query optimization, query processing, and transactions.   This is not
a course on database design or SQL programming (though we will discuss these
issues briefly).  It is designed for students who have taken 6.033 (or
equivalent); no prior database experience is assumed though students who have
taken an undergraduate course in databases are encouraged to attend.

</p>

<p>

Classes will consist of lectures and discussions based on readings
from the database literature.  For 6.830, there will be a semester long project,
as well as two exams and 7 additional assignments -- 3 Java based programming
"Labs" and 4 problem sets.  For 6.814, exams and assignments are the same as 6.830, but
instead of the semester project, there will be 2 additional labs.

<p>

<i> Enrollment may be limited. </i>

<P>

<h3>Lectures</h3>

Lectures are held twice a week, from 1:00-2:30 in 32-155 on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Attendance at lectures is
mandatory and you are expected to show up prepared to answer questions and 
participate in discussion.

<h3>Topics Covered</h3>

Topics related to the engineering and design of database systems, including: data models; database and schema design; schema normalization and integrity constraints; query processing; query optimization and cost estimation; transactions; recovery; concurrency control; isolation and consistency; distributed, parallel, and heterogeneous databases; adaptive databases; trigger systems; pub-sub systems; semi-structured data and XML querying.  Lecture and readings from original research papers. 6.830 includes semester-long project and paper.


<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>

Students should have taken 6.033 (Introduction to Systems) or equivalent as
well as 6.006 or 6.046 (Introduction to Algorithms) or equivalent. If you do not have
experience in these subjects and would like to take the course, please email
the instructor.  Prior database experience is not required.

</p>

<h3>Units</h3>

<p>

3-0-9.  6.830 is a Grad-H class.  It counts as an engineering concentration
(EC) subject in Systems.  For Area II Ph.D. students in EECS, it satisfies the Systems TQE requirement.

<p>

6.814 is a undergraduate class designed to satisfy the AUS requirement
in the EECS curriculum.  It counts as an engineering concentration
(EC) subject in Systems.

</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>

Grades are assigned based on labs, homeworks, 2 quizzes, final project (for 6.830), and
class participation.  The grading breakdown is as follows:

</p>

Grading is handled different for the two versions of the class:

<p>

6.830
<ul>
<li> Assignment (Problem Sets and Labs): 35% total
<li> Exams: 20% each
<li> Final Project: 20%
<li> Class Participation: 5%
</ul> 

<p>

6.814
<ul>
<li> Assignment (Problem Sets and Labs): 50% total
<li> Exams: 20% each
<li> Class Participation: 10%
</ul> 


<p>

<a name="latedays"></a>
Each student is allowed 3 "late days", each of which may be used to
turn in one problem set or lab one class meeting later than it is due without
penalty.  After all three late days are used, assignments will be
docked one letter grade for each class meeting they are late.  

<p>

Late days may not be used for the final project/lab 5 or exams. Regardless of late days,
problem sets must be handed in before problem set solutions are posted, usually a week after
the problem set is due.
</p>

<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>

<p>

For problem sets and labs, you are allowed to discuss your answers with other students,
but please write up your own answers and list your collaborators.  Copying
solutions from other students is never allowed.  For the group project you
will work in teams and hand in only one written report.

</p>

<h3><a name="text">Text</a></h3>

<p>

The course readings will primarily be drawn from the 4th Edition of
``Readings in Database Systems'', edited by Stonebraker and
Hellerstein as well as the textbook "<a

Systems</a>" from Ramakrishnan and Gehrke. <p> Both texts are
available from the MIT Coop.  Note that the 3rd Edition of "Readings
In Database Systems" is a substantially different text (it does not
include the same readings as the 4th edition.)  Also, note that
"Readings in Database Systems" is <a

online from Books 24x7.com</a> (free registration is required) if you
are accessing from an MIT IP address (this URL was updated 10/1/07).

</p>

<h3>Supplemental Readings</h3>

<p>

There will be several other readings that will be posted on the course web site.

<p>

6.033 is a prerequisite.  You may wish to review the 6.033 class notes, especially
during our discussion of transactions and logging.
